Classes and Inheritance


cpp question:

Constructor and Destructor
Question:
Write a class Rectangle that contains:

Private attributes length and width.
A parameterized constructor to initialize these attributes.
A destructor to print a message when the object is destroyed.
Write a member function to calculate and return the area of the rectangle. 
Demonstrate the functionality by creating an object and calculating its area. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Rectangle{
private:
float length;
float width;
public:
Rectangle(float len,float wid)
{
length=len;
width=wid;
}
~Rectangle(){
cout<<"destructor destroyed object"<<endl;
}
float Area()  {
        return length * width;
    }
};
int main()
{
Rectangle rec(12.5,3.5);
cout<<"area"<<rec.Area()<<endl;
return 0;
}


Inheritance
Question:
Create a base class Employee with:

Attributes: name (string) and id (int).
A member function display() to print these details.
Derive a class Manager that has an additional attribute department (string).
 Override the display() function to include the department in the output. 
Create objects of both classes and call their respective display() functions.

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

class Employee{
public:
string name;
int id;

Employee(string empname,int empid ){
name=empname;
id=empid;
}
virtual void display(){
cout <<"employe name"<<name<<endl;
cout<<"employe id"<<id<<endl;
}
};
class Manager :public Employee{
private:
string department;
public:
Manager(string empName, int empId, string dept)
        : Employee(empName, empId), department(dept) {}

 void display() override {
        Employee::display(); 
        cout << "department " << department << endl;
    }
};
int main() {

    Employee emp("shashank", 101);
    cout << "employee detail" << endl;
    emp.display();
    cout << endl;

  
    Manager mgr("Sachin", 102, "engineer");
    cout << "manager class detail" << endl;
    mgr.display();

    return 0;
}
