cpp question:

Constructor and Destructor
Question:
Write a class Rectangle that contains:

Private attributes length and width.
A parameterized constructor to initialize these attributes.
A destructor to print a message when the object is destroyed.
Write a member function to calculate and return the area of the rectangle. 
Demonstrate the functionality by creating an object and calculating its area. 

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
class Rectangle{
	private:
		double length;
		double width;
	public:
		Rectangle(double length, double width){
			this->length = length;
			this->width = width;
		}
		~Rectangle(){
			cout<<"Object is Destroyed "<<endl;
		}
		
		double Area(){
			return len * wid;
		}
};

int main(){
	Rectangle rect(23,56);
	double area = rect.Area();
	cout<<area<<endl;
}

Inheritance
Question:
Create a base class Employee with:

Attributes: name (string) and id (int).
A member function display() to print these details.
Derive a class Manager that has an additional attribute department (string).
 Override the display() function to include the department in the output. 
Create objects of both classes and call their respective display() functions.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
private:
    string name;
    int id;

public:
    Employee(string name, int id){
        this->name= name;
        this->id = id;
    }

    void display()  {
        cout << "Employee Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Employee ID: " << id << endl;
    }


};


class Manager : public Employee {
private:
    string department;

public:
    Manager(string name, int id, string department) : Employee(name, id) {
        this->department = department;
    }

    void display()  {
        Employee::display(); 
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
    }


};

int main() {
    Employee emp("Nihal", 111);
    cout << "Employee :" << endl;
    emp.display();

    cout << endl;

    Manager mana("Honour", 222, "IT");
    cout << "Manager :" << endl;
    mana.display();

   
    return 0;
}
